	missing implementation:
- free every node
- arrays
- freeing statements variables
--(enumerate statement blocks and assign it to the symrec while allocating them)
-- after block execution remove the varibale
-- this implies to change the symrec struct to have a pointer to previous and next
- check if is possibile to do recursive function calls
